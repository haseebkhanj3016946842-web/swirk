  <h1> A Powerful Courtroom Drama
 </h1>
  <p>12 Angry Men is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet. The story takes place almost entirely in a jury room, where twelve men must decide the fate of a teenage boy accused of murder. What begins as an open-and-shut case soon becomes a tense debate as one juror, Juror 8, challenges the others to carefully examine the evidence. The film explores themes of justice, prejudice, moral responsibility, and the importance of reasonable doubt. With its gripping dialogue and powerful performances, 12 Angry Men remains one of the most influential and thought-provoking films in cinema history.</p>
